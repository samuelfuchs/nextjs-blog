Here are some timeless quotes I adapted to my personal philosophy over the last months:

- The cost of procrastination is the **life** you could've lived.
- Experience shapes the **brain**. _(Atomic Habits)_
- Habit, if not resisted, soon becomes **necessity**. _(St. Augustine)_
- Our great danger is not that we aim too high for lofty goals and fail, but that we aim too low, for mediocrity, and we **succeed**.
- The greatest threat to success is **not** failure, but boredom.
